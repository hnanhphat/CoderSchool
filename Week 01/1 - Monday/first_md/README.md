## Name and background
Hello everyone, my full name is Hoang Nguyen Anh Phat and I'm 24 years old. I come from Hoa Sen University with Information Technology Major. After completing the score in school, I do a lot of jobs like Baker, Personal Trainer, ... and the job I worked as long as possible is Frontend Developer in a Japanese company.

## My hobbies
I have a few of my favorites like:
- Watching Movie.
- Reading Book.
- Searching Tarot Card Meaning.
- Walking around and listening to music.

## My programming experience
I work with **Wordpress** for **over 1 year**.

## The interesting of this course
I want to change my job, improve my English skills and learn more about coding skills. Coincidentally my brother introduced me to CoderSchool.

## Things that I'm worried
The first thing I worry about is that my ***English skills are not good*** and then after the course, I ***cannot find the job*** with the salary that I want.

## My favorite quote
This is a small part from Kungfu Panda.
> Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift

## My favorite music
This song is the main music from the movie Aquaman, a movie I really like.
